<h1>Client Terminal Events</h1> 
<h2><a id="init"></a>Init</h2> 
<p><span>Immediately after the client terminal loads a program (an Expert Advisor or custom indicator) and starts the process of initialization of global variables, the Init event will be sent, which will be processed by <a href="/basis/function/events#oninit">OnInit()</a> event handler, if there is such. This event is also generated after a financial instrument and/or chart timeframe is changed, after a program is recompiled in MetaEditor, after input parameters are changed from the setup window of an Expert Advisor or a custom indicator. An Expert Advisor is also initialized after the account is changed.</span></p> 
<h2><a id="deinit"></a>Deinit</h2> 
<p><span>Before global variables are deinitialized and the program (Expert Advisor or custom indicator) is unloaded, the client terminal sends the Deinit event to the program. Deinit is also generated when the client terminal is closed, when a chart is closed, right before the security and/or timeframe is changed, at a successful program re-compilation, when input parameters are changed, and when account is changed.</span></p> 
<p><span>The <a href="/constants/namedconstants/uninit">deinitialization reason</a> can be obtained from the parameter, passed to the <a href="/basis/function/events#ondeinit">OnDeinit()</a> function. The OnDeinit() function run is restricted to 2.5 seconds. If during this time the function hasn't been completed, then it is forcibly terminated.</span></p> 
<h2><a id="start"></a>Start</h2> 
<p><span>The </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Start</span><span> event is a special event for script activation after it is loaded. This event is processed by <a href="/basis/function/events#onstart">OnStart</a> handler. The Start event is not send to Expert Advisors or custom indicators.</span></p> 
<h2><a id="newtick"></a>NewTick</h2> 
<p><span>The </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">NewTick</span><span> event is generated if there are new quotes, it is processed by <a href="/basis/function/events#ontick">OnTick()</a> of Expert Advisors attached. In case when OnTick function for the previous quote is being processed when a new quote is received, the new quote will be ignored by an Expert Advisor, because the corresponding event will not enqueued.</span></p> 
<p><span>All new quotes that are received while the program is running are ignored until the OnTick() is completed. After that the function will run only after a new quote is received. The NewTick event is generated irrespective of whether automated trade is allowed or not ("Allow/prohibit Auto trading" button). The prohibition of automated trading denotes only that sending of trade requests from an Expert Advisor is not allowed, while the Expert Advisor keeps working.</span></p> 
<p><span>The prohibition of automated trading by pressing the appropriate button will not stop the current execution of the OnTick() function.</span></p> 
<h2><a id="calculate"></a>Calculate</h2> 
<p><span>The </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Calculate</span><span> event is generated only for indicators right after the Init event is sent and at any change of price data. It is processed by the <a href="/basis/function/events#oncalculate">OnCalculate</a> function.</span></p> 
<h2><a id="timer"></a>Timer</h2> 
<p><span>The </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Timer</span><span> event is periodically generated by the client terminal for the Expert Advisor that has activated the timer by the <a href="/eventfunctions/eventsettimer">EventSetTimer</a> function. Usually, this function is called by OnInit. Timer event processing is performed by the <a href="/basis/function/events#ontimer">OnTimer</a> function. After the operation of the Expert Advisor is completed, it is necessary to destroy the timer using the <a href="/eventfunctions/eventkilltimer">EventKillTimer</a> function, which is usually called in the OnDeinit function.</span></p> 
<h2><a id="tester"></a>Tester</h2> 
<p><span>The </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tester</span><span> event is generated after testing of an Expert Advisor on history data is over. The event is handled by the </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="/basis/function/events#ontester">OnTester()</a></span><span> function.</span></p> 
<h2><a id="chartevent"></a>ChartEvent</h2> 
<p><span>The </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">ChartEvent</span><span> <a href="/constants/chartconstants/enum_chartevents">event is generated</a> by the client terminal when a user is working with a chart:</span></p>
