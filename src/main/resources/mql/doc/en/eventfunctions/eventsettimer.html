<p><span>Parameters</span></p> 
<p><span>seconds</span></p> 
<p><span>[in] Number of seconds that determine the frequency of the timer event occurrence.</span></p> 
<p><span>Return Value</span></p> 
<p><span>In case of success returns true, otherwise false. In order to get an <a href="/constants/errorswarnings/errorcodes">error code</a>, the <a href="/check/getlasterror">GetLastError()</a> function should be called.</span></p> 
<p><span>Note</span></p> 
<p><span>Normally, this function must be called from the <a href="/basis/function/events#oninit">OnInit()</a> function or from a class <a href="/basis/types/classes#constructor">constructor</a>. In order to handle events coming from the timer, the Expert Advisor must have the <a href="/basis/function/events#ontimer">OnTimer()</a> function.</span></p> 
<p style="margin: 8px 17px 7px 30px;"><span>Every Expert Advisor, as well as every indicator works with its own timer and receives events only from it. As soon as a mql4 program stops operating, the timer is destroyed forcibly if it was created but hasn't been disabled by the <a href="/eventfunctions/eventkilltimer">EventKillTimer()</a> function.</span></p> 
<p><span>For each program no more than one timer can be run. Each mql4 program and each chart has its own queue of events, in which all the newly received events are placed. If the <a href="/runtime/event_fire#timer">Timer</a> event is present in the queue or is being processed, the new Timer event will not be placed in the queue of the mql4 program. </span></p>
