<p><span>Typically, this function must be called from a function <a href="/basis/function/events#ondeinit">OnDeinit()</a>, if the <a href="/eventfunctions/eventsettimer">EventSetTimer()</a> function has been called from <a href="/basis/function/events#oninit">OnInit()</a>. This function can also be called form the class destructor, if the EventSetTimer() function has been called in the <a href="/basis/types/classes#destructor">constructor</a> of this class.</span></p> 
<p style="margin: 8px 17px 7px 30px;"><span>Every Expert Advisor, as well as every indicator works with its own timer and receives events only from it. As soon as a mql4 program stops operating, the timer is destroyed forcibly if it was created but hasn't been disabled by the EventKillTimer() function.</span></p>
